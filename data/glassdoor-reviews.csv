Hire faster. You are always short handed. Realize that Colorado has a higher cost of living than Alabama so pay accordingly.,"Pension is a joke. It's only like $56 per month per year you work there. So after 20 years you'll get $1120 to live off in retirement. Worse yet, that amount hasn't gone up in years. So it's obviously not keeping up with inflation. At the rate of inflation and its stagnation, you'll be doing good if that equates to $300 in today's money to live off.

This is all used as an excuse to match employees 401ks by only 3% instead of the standard 6% other companies offer.

The raises are standardized at 3% per year which again isn't keeping up with real inflation.

,"Ball Corporate is an organization on auto-pilot in many ways. Innovation is not valued in Ball Corporate. It has market dominance and a reliable, safe strategy (for now) that seems to have served Ball for many decades. With regards to Analytics, Ball as an organization only cares about operational reporting. There is little interest in Analytics and BI as an org. There are people and teams that want this sort of analytics, but they face internal bureaucracy that limits them. Of my 15+ years in BI, this is the first time I've encountered a situation where BI and DW are seen as just another IT cost, not value add (as opposed to everywhere else I've been). Expect your career to stagnate if you take a BI position here. This type of role is best taken at the end of your career, especially if the Pros listed are appealing to you.

To recap: Ball places no value on collected data, it's only a cost to be lowered. If they are desperate for an occasional operational metric, that's why they have BI roles, otherwise you'll be bored out of your mind.

Remember it's not the supervisors that get things done at the plants. It's the ""hourly"" employees. Most of us have to tell the supervisors how to do they're job. If you give your hourly employees family time then they will come to work happy boost production. If not then production will go down.

Be transparent with the point system. Let everyone employee know within 24 hours via email or automated text that he or she received a punitive point. So the employee could dispute it if necessary.,"No overtime after 8 Hours
No night differential 
No Union
No differential for working at high demand stations or equipment such as the printer Station.
Overly punitive point system with no transparency for the workers. Points are issued to easily. And often lead to termination.
Workers can't see their clock rings (punch in/on) and are often issued punitive points without knowledge. Not given notice if points issued until they accumulate above 4. If a worker forgets to clock out unknowingly or if machine is inaccurate, the employee will be issued a punitive point without any given notice. I believe they do this to weed out who they don't like and keep certain employees from having an opportunity to advance in the company. Often workers are told by a manager that they took care of it, later to find that they didn't. 

Turnover is high because of it.

My advice to management at the corporate level is to come in and clean house. Your management is inexperienced and its affecting the overall performance of the plant.

VP has been to Monticello multiple times this year and blamed the poor plant performance on management and not the hourly employees but still no action has been taken to fix this.

"Be more proactive about listening to suggestions from the staff, make improvements to the IT department (literally no one likes having to contact IT) and be receptive to change. This company is too ""old fashioned"" in their ethic, and it needs to be brought to current industry standards. There's a reason why talent is leaving, and it's because everything is stuck 20 years in the past (improve your diversity by hiring young talent that is current on industry standards and trends).","Departments are severely understaffed to the point everyone works more than 40 hours a week. Upper D-level management is not willing to listen to suggestions for improvement. They are severely lacking in their IT department, refusing the use of new software or tools that would be nice to have (hard no, even on free applications). The ""technology"" that is used is so outdated, and the reliance on complicated Excel sheets instead of business intelligence tools is absurd. Some of the management I've worked with aren't looking to try and make improvements, declining any suggestions. Communication with upper management is challenging, given their packed schedules - they don't return emails or calls but expect work to be done (and work that requires their input). Departments don't interact with each other, and communication between them gets messy; you often need to make several attempts to get an answer and there is no direct point of contact. Outlined objectives are rarely worked on, leaving departments to be reactive instead of proactive, always ""putting out the fire"" instead of improving work flow and methods. Despite the generous vacation time, it's hard to actually book more than 1-2 days off at a time because there's so much work to be done and one missed day causes huge impacts and delays. Management doesn't seem to like someone calling in sick, even in an emergency (with a medical note). Everything just moves very slowly, even though everyone is busy (probably because the delays in senior management). There are also SO many meetings that prevent people from getting work done - I manage several calendars and people have been booked for 30+ hours of meetings in one week, leading to ""mandatory"" overtime as people have work that needs to get done.",7,0,2021-05-14T05:27:19.247,2021-05-14,REGULAR,46934158,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,Administrative Assistant,2,"Denver, CO","Decent pay, benefits started immediately, nice bonus, generous vacation time.
