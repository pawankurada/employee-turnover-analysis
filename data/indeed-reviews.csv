It doesn't matter what your site-specific issues are, there is a Division plan you SHALL follow and that plan often detracts from activity at your site.At the corporate level, there seems to be so much concern with either litigation or tarnishing the Ball image that plants are rarely able to handle difficult employees the way they need to - handling personnel problems are mandated from Corporate.  On the flip side, rewarding good employees is undermined because working for Ball is ""about the experience, not the pay""...But when site managers know the pay is not good & the work environment is challenging, something about that has to go - it tends to be good employees.Compound these perspectives with the fact that Corporate & Division are often at odds - and give conflicting direction - and you can imagine the challenge of managing around THAT minefield.  We're often told to come to either for support, instead we tend to get more tasks by both.I strongly encourage you to ask the right questions about autonomy if you're applying for a management role at a Ball production facility.","Always handing out swag, A lot of lunches","Micro-managing at Division & Corporate level, Mediocre pay"

Management has no clue how retention works in relation to hiring property for such, people come and go mainly because of the schedule and environment. Main focus is production so training falls to the wayside unless a new hire shows out and puts themselves in the picture. Tons of advancement if your the buddy buddy type.

They don't care how the other plants that have been doing this successfully for decades are doing it only how the Henkel people want to do it. It didn't work out there and it's obviously not working here. Production Technicians are supposed to be just that technicians. Some are but there are some that do everything to avoid actually doing any work and pawn it off on skilled trades. ""Maintenance"" is supposed to do the rebuilding and major repairs but since upper management is from a multicraft background they end up doing a whole lot of stuff they're paying Production Technicians to do.

2023-02-21,2,Ball is a toxic place to work that only retains employees who feel they have no choice but to stay for the pay despite how miserable they are.,"Quality Assurance Inspector (Former Employee) - Golden, CO - February 21, 2023What is the best part of working at the company?They pay well and have good benefits because no one would work there if they didn’t.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They put a lot of pressure on people. I had more work to do in 12 hours than was possible to get done without cheating things. I never finished everything and it always bothered me. I worked myself to the bone every day trying.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Very toxic. They only care about profit and have no care at all what they are doing to people. They have a very domineering approach to motivation and use threats to “motivate.” People only stay because they either can’t do anything else (qualifications), or they need the pay and insurance despite how miserable they are and they are just riding it out until they can retire.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hit the ground running every shift and cross your fingers that you get a break. Be undermined at every turn. Very little instruction on how to do your job but lots and lots of condemnation for not knowing. And in my department, if you do your job right, you constantly create more work for yourself and cut out your own break time. Lots of physical pain from the conditions of working there but so much mandatory overtime that you can’t go to the doctor. Go home and have stress dreams about trying to get everything done while at work. It’s really hard on families and relationships.",,

The work environment can be laid back but also can feel overwhelming at times depending on how well production is running. The only downside to working at Ball is the day/night shift rotation every 3 months. It is hard to adjust to a normal life if you have a family but with 4 days on 4 days off it makes it tolerable.

Over the next few years lines will be added and the plant will slowly grow to its full capacity. During that time there will be a lot of advancement opportunities. Until THAT dust settles, what there is is essentially a hyper-aggressive, self-first culture. I was looking forward to being part of helping to develop a culture from the ground up at a new plant. But the reality is most of the people that work there are from the Cascades plant that closed down. Whatever nasty culture they had there was brought to this plant. I was also looking forward to gaining more technical knowledge, compared to what my previous machine-operating jobs had exposed me to. The classroom was fun and elucidating and so was getting some one-on-one with a few engineers here and there. Unfortunately, on the job, you have coworkers who will ""hog"" all the learning opportunities, unless you get really aggressive with putting yourself ""in there.""

It can also make it difficult when trying to learn new things. Pay is definitely above average for an operator job. Medical insurance is terrible. They do give you $1500/yr for a health savings account, but it still leaves a lot of money out of your pocket to cover up to your deductible. Vacation starting out is about on par with most places, but you can’t roll over to the next year. It can be hard to schedule days off sometimes because as a startup plant, we are understaffed and can only allow a couple of people off per shift. The work life balance is good with a 3 on, 3 off schedule. It may bother some folks to swing days to nights every 6 rotations. But it’s also a fair way of doing things. Overall a good place to work if you want something to keep you busy and make the 12 hour shifts go by fast.

As the years passed many of their ""plans"" fell through and many of the promises never came to pass.  Eventually the union and local management began to but heads and not work together to find the common ground.  The local management only wanted to do what they wanted without any consideration given to hourly employees.  The company announced the closure of our plant at the end of year 2016 and even then they did very little to help employees.  They promised help finding with job fairs and resume classes.  They did have the resume classes, which I was told were of little value, and no job fairs.  There were many employees who tried to transfer to other Ball facilities but were met with very little consideration.  I think that was only because Ball does not like unions and does not want the union mentality in their plants.  The only thing I have seen that Ball does well is close plants.  They have close at least four plants before my plant, in the little time the ran our plant.",benefits,"don't listen to employees ideas, don't utilize skilled workers"
